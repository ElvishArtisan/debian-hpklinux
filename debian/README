This is the README file for the "hpklinux" AudioScience HPI driver.

HPI is a sound card API for use with the line of audio adapters manufactured
by AudioScience (https://audioscience.com/). It is similar to (though not
compatible with) the generic ALSA system used for many sound devices on
Linux, while providing additional high-end features that are useful for
professional broadcast audio applications.

The driver can be activated by enabling the 'hpklinux' Systemd service, as
follows:

	systemctl enable hpklinux
	systemctl start hpklinux
